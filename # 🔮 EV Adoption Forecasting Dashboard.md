# ðŸ”® EV Adoption Forecasting Dashboard

An interactive Streamlit web application that forecasts county-level Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption for the next 3 years using historical data and machine learning.  
This project was developed as part of **AICTE Internship Cycle 2**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **County Selection** â€“ View historical & forecasted EV adoption trends for any county.
- **3-Year Forecast** â€“ Predict cumulative EV adoption using a trained regression model.
- **Multi-County Comparison** â€“ Compare adoption growth across up to 3 counties.
- **Growth Insights** â€“ Display forecasted growth percentages.
- **Downloadable Forecast** â€“ Export forecast data as CSV.
